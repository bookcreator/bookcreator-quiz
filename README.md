# Book Creator Quiz

The purpose of this test is mainly for us to get an idea of your technical capability. It will also serve as a starting point for discussions about how you think about and communicate the decisions you make when you write code, should you get through to the next stage.

## What is the task?

The results page is not looking great. It currently has leaderboard data from the API which returns 10,000 mocked existing scores with the user's submission included. Everyone has their score out of 3 for their answered questions, plus a random 'skill' score of between 0 and 3000 (otherwise there would be 10k rows of scores between 0-3). The task is to finish the results page so that the leaderboard data is presented in a reasonable way.

If you have time then you could add some further embellishments. To kick start your thinking, here are some ideas. Feel free to pick one of these if your creative juices aren't flowing today.
1. Capture the user's name at the start of the quiz and use that in the leaderboard instead of "Player 1".
2. Implement sorting on the leaderboard.
3. Implement search or filtering on the leaderboard.
4. Something else entirely.

## What are we looking for?

We'll use the following rubric to evaluate your submission.

1. Is the table well presented?
2. Is the user's score in view?
3. Have they used pagination or virtulaisation or are all 10k scores rendered?
4. Have they added any embellishments?
5. Can I still build and run the code locally from a clean checkout?
6. Is the code clean, readable and well structured?
7. Have they thought about testing? (Comprehensive tests are not expected but some consideration of testability would be nice to see.)

## Are there any restrictions?
Not really, go wild! Feel free to add any dependencies you need (although we might ask you to justify your decisions at the interview stage). Use AI coding tools (but be prepared to stand by the code you submit). Spend as much or as little time as you want (we think that you should be able to achieve something cool in an hour or two and you might get penalised if we feel you've over engineered things.)

## How do I submit the test?
Make a private fork of this repo and make a PR against that. Invite @tteggel and @thebiffboff as reviewers.

Feel free to contact the person who sent you this test if you have any questions at all. Good luck!
